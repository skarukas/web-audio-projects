            <ol>
                <li>Every second, the fundamental frequency of all currently sounding frequencies is guessed.*</li>
                <li>A random harmonic (2 &lt= <em>n</em> &lt= 9) of this fundamental is generated. If there aren't any existing frequencies, a random frequency is generated instead.</li>
                <li>This new frequency is normalized to the range of 256-1024 Hz using some weird math.</li>
                <li>Repeat!</li>
            </ol>
            <p> Each tone generated lasts between 2 and 5 seconds, and the fundamental frequency will slowly evolve as certain notes appear and disappear. They'll have a slight pitch bend 5% of the time, just for fun.</p>
            <em>*This is calculated quick and dirty, by finding an unreliable sort of GCD (greatest common divisor) of a set of floating-point numbers. The fundamental will occasionally be erroneously calculated as a low number (&lt 5 Hz) meaning the generated tones may be very close together and dissonant. Sorry :(</em>
